The GnowDB features are exposed via REST API

To set up the server on your system and use the GnowDB features, follow the steps:

Clone the directory gnowdb on your system

Go to the directory 'gnowdb'

Type 'lein ring server' on the command line to start the server.

The server will start on 'localhost:xxxx' where xxxx is the port number

Go to 'localhost:xxxx/login' to login either as a user or an admin. There are certain features which only need to identify the username and password  supplied in the POST request, whereas certain features require authorization as a 'user' or an 'admin'.

To use the api through command line, we make use of curl. Here is a sample curl command to login:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"username":"a","password":"abc"}' --cookie-jar ./cookies.txt localhost:3000/login -i

This will return:

HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 17:51:16 GMT
Location: /api
Set-Cookie: ring-session=ba99d3f6-b0e5-4b68-96a2-0a77e8eea404;Path=/;HttpOnly
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)

The login form expects POSTing a map with keys :username and :password as shown. --cookie-jar will help in storing the session as a cookie in cookies.txt. 

'Location: /api' in the response means it's redirecting you to the welcome page of gnowdb api.

You can check by typing:

curl -X GET localhost:3000/api  -i

Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 17:54:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 21
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)

WELCOME TO GNOWDB API


Now, you can test whether you are a user or an admin using the sample uri's provided as below:

curl -X GET --cookie ./cookies.txt localhost:3000/role-user  -i

Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 17:55:46 GMT
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 14
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)

You're a user!

curl -X GET --cookie ./cookies.txt localhost:3000/role-admin  -i

Response:

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 17:56:38 GMT
Content-Length: 47
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)

Sorry, you do not have access to this resource.

The below url is to check if you are authenticated or not, and doesn't put restriction on your role. 

curl -X GET --cookie ./cookies.txt localhost:3000/requires-authentication  -i

Response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 17:57:26 GMT
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 26
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)

Thanks for authenticating!

Now, you can access the GnowDB functions as per the access given to you as a user or an admin.

You can logout as:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 18:00:00 GMT
Location: /api
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)

This is redirectiong the user to the welcome page for the api : localhost:3000/api

Now if you try to authenticate or authorize it will redirect you to the login page until you start a new ring login session

curl -X GET --cookie ./cookies.txt localhost:3000/requires-authentication  -i

Response:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Wed, 12 Jul 2017 18:01:32 GMT
Location: http://localhost:3000/login
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.6.8.v20121106)
